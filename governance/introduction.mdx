Boundless has built the first permissionless proof marketplace. Early governance prioritizes safety, continuity, and the ability to iterate quickly while the protocol matures and more usage emerges. Handing over control of key protocol functions (protocol upgrades, grants, token upgrades, emergency and governance updates) to the community with a phased approach as the network moves toward full decentralization targeted for September 2026.

## Governance changes expected in 2026

Boundless exists to make zero-knowledge proofs available to every blockchain. Achieving that goal requires more than a permissionless market, it requires governance that can operate credibly at scale.

Governance on Boundless will transition from foundation/labs-led model to one enforced by staked ZKC holders. By September 2026:

- Protocol upgrades, grants, and governance changes will proceed only if they are not vetoed by the community
- Token upgrades will require explicit approval from staked ZKC holders
- Emergency actions will remain possible, with execution moving toward an independent security council

This approach ensures that as Boundless becomes a shared piece of infrastructure across the internet, no single party retains unilateral control over how it evolves.

## Transparency
