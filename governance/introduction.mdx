Boundless has successfully built the first permissionless proof marketplace; the next step is to enable governance of the Boundless protocol by staked \$ZKC holders.

- Early governance will prioritize safety, continuity, and rapid iteration while the protocol matures.
- Key protocol functions will transfer to the community through a phased approach, targeting full decentralization by September 2026.

## Timeline

By September 2026:

- Protocol upgrades, grants, and governance changes proceed unless the community vetoes them
- Token upgrades require explicit approval from staked ZKC holders
- Emergency actions remain possible, transitioning to an independent security council

This ensures no single party retains unilateral control as Boundless becomes shared infrastructure.
