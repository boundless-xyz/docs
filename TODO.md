# TODO

## ADK (Agent Development Kit) page

Add a new docs page documenting the ADK -- our approach to making Boundless AI-native. The ADK page should cover the skills shipped in [PR #1620](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/pull/1620) (`boundless skill install` + first-request, boundless-overview, contributing-skills).

Wait for PR #1620 to merge, then document the `first-request` skill as the primary onboarding flow.

## Make docs AI-native

Shift the docs to be AI-native. Keep SDK documentation for LLMs and AI consumption, but reframe the developer experience around skills and the ADK rather than traditional SDK usage.

## GCP image/input uploads documentation

Review the recent GCP additions and update the docs to cover how to use GCP for image/input uploads when making proof requests.

## New skills to build and document

- **SP1 to RISC Zero migration skill**: guides migrating SP1 guest programs to RISC Zero zkVM guest programs
